        <h3 class="faq-question">What is the main focus of the paper "Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems"?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">The main focus of the paper is to highlight the concept of technical debt in machine learning (ML)
           systems. It emphasizes that while ML systems can be developed and deployed quickly,
            they often accumulate hidden technical debt due to their complexity, data dependencies, 
            and system-level interactions. This debt can lead to significant long-term maintenance costs, 
            and the paper aims to raise awareness about the risks and provide strategies to mitigate it.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What are some key factors that contribute to technical debt in ML systems?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">The paper identifies several key factors that contribute to technical debt in ML systems, including:

          Data dependencies: ML systems rely heavily on data, and changes in data can lead to unexpected issues.
          
          Feedback loops: Both direct and hidden feedback loops can cause systems to behave unpredictably.
          
          Anti-patterns: Common design flaws such as glue code, pipeline jungles, and dead experimental codepaths.
          
          Configuration debt: Managing configurations in large ML systems can be challenging, and errors can lead to significant problems.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What are some anti-patterns mentioned in the paper?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The paper identifies several anti-patterns in ML system design, including:

          Glue code: Excessive use of ad-hoc code to connect different components, leading to fragility.
          
          Pipeline jungles: Overly complex and tangled data processing pipelines.
          
          Dead experimental codepaths: Unused or obsolete code from past experiments that remains in the system.</p>
